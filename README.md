# Brackets-instant-prototype
## Prototype Cordova apps from within Brackets

## !!! WARNING !!!
This is in development. It's very early on and it's likely to be a bumpy road for you.
Check back in a few weeks for a more tested, proven version of this.

## Installation
Use the extension manager, than go into the folder of the extension. Change into the ``node`` directory and run ``npm install``.
An example for OSX:

```shell
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Brackets/extensions/user/InstantPrototyper/node
    npm install
```

Now start Brackets and choose a project that has an ``index.html`` at it's root directory.
Press CMD+Shift+L to start the prototyping session - a window with a QR code should appear.

Scan this QR Code with the InstantPrototyper app.

You're up and running now!

To update the app of all clients, hit CMD+Shift+U.
